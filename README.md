A "flappy bird"-like superhero flying game, made using the java.awt library


How it works

1) The game involves a hero flying through the sky, trying to collect orbs and move through gaps in the incoming walls.
2) The controls are simple - Use the up arrow key to go up and the down arrow key to go down. 
3) Increase your score by collecting incoming orbs. When an orb is collected, the score is updated by one
4) A collision with one of the incoming walls results in the hero bursting into flames and the player losing the game
